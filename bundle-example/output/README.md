Listed folders are created during installation with `backbase-cli`:

* `bb_components` - item dependencies
* `bower_components` - all client-side dependencies of bundle itself and all the widgets that it contains
* `conf` - RequireJS configuration and `file-tree.json`, for importing dependencies on client-side and build process

All listed folder names could be configured.
