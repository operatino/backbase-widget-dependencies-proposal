Portal setup looks the same as `bundle-example`. Portal could have any widget/bundle as a dependency in `package.json`, that will be installed after `backbase install` (ream more in root README.md).

You could then define any build script you want, using `conf/assets-tree.json`, with all assets dependencies.
